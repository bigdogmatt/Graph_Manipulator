# Graph_Manipulator
Created November 2018:
<br />A program that takes a txt file of a graph and preforms different tasks specified by the user.  
The user can:  
 - Print the graph
 - See if the graph is connected
 - Create an MST of the graph
 - See if the graph is metric
 - Make the graph metric
 - Find the shortest path from one node to all other nodes
 - Find a shortest TSP tour
 - Find the approx TSP using shortcuts
 <br />An example of a graph.txt file can be seen below:
<br />6
<br />2 1 5 5 6
<br />2 0 5 2 3
<br />3 1 3 3 4 5 2
<br />2 2 4 4 5
<br />2 3 5 5 7
<br />3 0 6 2 2 4 7
